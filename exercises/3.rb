# Create a "shared" shopping list with a friend
# Create two data structures - one for your list of stuff, and one
# for your friend, e.g. you want milk, eggs, and bacon, and
# your friend wants beer, cookies, and apples.
# Programmatically combine the two arrays into a single list,
# sort the result (alphabetically), and write it to the screen.
# If the two lists contain the same item, only show it once!

my_shopping_list = ["beer", "eggs", "kale"]
brian_shopping_list = ["beer", "cookies", "bacon"]

puts my_shopping_list
puts brian_shopping_list

the_combined_list = my_shopping_list + brian_shopping_list
#puts the_combined_list
sorted_uniq_list = the_combined_list.sort.uniq
#puts sorted_list
uniquely_sorted_list = sorted_list.uniq
puts sorted_uniq_list

#Shared_shopping_list = [["milk", "eggs", "bacon"],["beer", "cookies", "apples"]]
#puts Shared_shopping_list.sort_by
